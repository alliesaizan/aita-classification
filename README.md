Please note, some of the files needed to be zipped to accomodate Git Large File Storage. The raw data [folder](data/raw) and [trained model](results/) are zip files. You can find the original project structure in my [OneDrive folder](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkUOTbaWXaF8gbtE71qCMCRxTM3rvQ?e=RhnEYH) (view-only!).
